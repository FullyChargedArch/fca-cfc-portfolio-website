My love, 
she's as soft as the rain,
in my eyes

My love, 
would never cause me pain,
without a why

Oh she's perfect,
the only one for me
Oh I love her,
more than anything

Her love,
is as sweet as honey,
in my tea

But her love,
cuts like diamonds through
when her love, starts to freeze

Oh she's perfect,
the only one for me
I would give her,
all my smiles and dopamine

Oh she's perfect,
the only one for me,
and I love her,
more than she loves me

But she's perfect,
the only one for me
But I love her,
more than she loves me

I'm in love with the way you say you care
Broken promises and secrets shared
My heart feels heavy like a stone,
you threw into the river years ago

Leave me behind, and float away
I'll heal in time, but not today

I'm your burden
I'm your burden

The door's left open, your tea's gone cold
I feel no warmth, from your hold 
I'll fill a well with silver and gold
Wishing for the petals to return to your rose

Leave me behind, and float away
I'll heal in time, but not today

I'm your burden
I'm your burden

Oh I can see,
that I was blind
Watched the colours fade,
from your eyes so grey,
in the moon that night

I know it's over,
but I can't let you go
And I'm much too broken,
too feel alone

Oh I have felt,
felt your warmth freeze,
Broke the chains between
yourself and me,
to set yourself free

I know it's over,
but I can't let you go
And I'm much too broken,
too feel alone

I'll wait here for you,
to come back to me
And I'll wait forever,
it's you I need

It's you I need
It's you I need
It's you I need
It's you I need

Where did I go wrong?
Or was this always,
how its supposed to go?

Where in our story,
do we fall,
in love again?

Tell it to me baby,
please just tell me what I need to hear
I meant something to you
Tell me this is all just part of some big idea
That brings me back to you

I remember how,
you would kiss me,
before you'd say goodbye

I'll keep these memories,
deep inside me,
for when the time is right

Tell it to me baby, 
please just tell me what I need to hear
I meant something to you
Tell me this is all just part of some big idea
That brings me back to you

the songs we used to love

You and me, were meant to be
